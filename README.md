# ANZ-Data-Program
This repository for [Data@ANZ virtual program](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/ZLJCsrpkHo9pZBJNY/Data%40ANZ%20Program) which is a virtual short internship that allows you explore ANZ records of transactions over a short period to provide some useful insights and create a predictive model to identify the annual salary of the customers. 

The repository includes the dataset, the Jupyter notebook that I have done my analysis in and the powerpoint slides which summarises the analysis and insights during the program.
